The organizing team included [Dr. William Northrop](https://cse.umn.edu/me/william-northrop), [Shashi Shekhar](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/shashi-shekhar), and other fellow colleagues. The focus of the workshop was on examining vehicle emissions and investigating how Google Maps' fuel-efficient route options feature can contribute to a cleaner environment.

Participants got to tour the cutting-edge laboratories at the University of Minnesota and interact with esteemed faculty from the Computer Science Department. During these interactions, they learned about the latest research involving big datasets sourced from vehicle computers, uncovering valuable insights into fuel efficiency and strategies for creating more fuel-efficient vehicles.
